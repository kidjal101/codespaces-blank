		<p> This is by far my faviorite food I absolutley love Cheeseburgers!</p>
		<p> The Primary reason I love Chesseburgers is how creative you can be with them.</p>
		<p> Not only do I love the taste of Chesseburgers I love you can truly make it the way YOU want!</p>
		<p> Ultimatley how creative you can be with it as well as its Fantastic taste sements this as my Faviorite food of all Time!</p>

       <p>Pizza! Everyone loves It and I sure do, so much so that its my second faviorite food!</p>
       <p> Very rarely would I every turn down something like pizza, Its simply one of the most consistent, foods.</p>
<p> One of my faviorite things about Pizza Is again how creative you can be when making one!</p>
<p> Ultimatley, You can never go wrong with a Cheesy, Delectable Pie, There is a clear reason why Its one of the Most popular foods in the world!</p>   
		
		<img src="images/Chicken.webp" alt="Chicken" width="200">
		<p> Finally, Fried Chicken, although I do not like it as much as the other two I still thouroughlly enjoy it.</p>
		<p> As of right now I do not yet know how to make a proper meal and one of the first ones I want to make is Fried Chicken.</p>
       <p> One of my faviorite things about Fried Chicken is actually the sauce you can eat with it elevating the already Worderful Flavor.</p>
	   <p> Ultimatley, Fried Chicken is certainly my third faviorite food because of simply how great it taste along with the sides you can have along with it</p>
